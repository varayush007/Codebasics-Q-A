      "Mahendra Singh Dhoni (born 7 July 1981) is an Indian cricketer who currently serves as the captain of the Indian national cricket team in limited overs formats. He is a right-handed wicket-keeper batsman and an occasional right-arm off break bowler. Dhoni is widely regarded as one of the greatest captains in the history of cricket, having led the Indian team to victory in the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. He is the only captain to have won all three ICC trophies.\n",

      "Dhoni made his international debut in 2004 and has since gone on to play 90 Tests, 350 One Day Internationals (ODIs) and 98 Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is). He is the only player to have captained India in all three formats. He is the highest run-scorer for India in T20Is, with 1617 runs at an average of 37.60. He is also the fourth-highest run-scorer in ODIs for India, with 10,773 runs at an average of 50.57. In Tests, he has scored 4876 runs at an average of 38.09.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dhoni is a key member of the Indian team and has been praised for his leadership, composure and calmness under pressure. He is also known for his unorthodox batting style, which has seen him hit six sixes in an over on two occasions.\n",

      "Dhoni is one of the most popular and successful cricketers in the world. He is a role model for many young cricketers and has inspired a generation of fans. He is also a successful businessman and has endorsed a number of brands.\n",
